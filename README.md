##Development Environment

Last year while learning Python, I got a recomendation from [Matt Cowger (@mcowger)](http://twitter.com/mcowger) on PyCharm as an IDE. At first I 
struggled a bit with it, but I have to say i have grown to really appreciate the spit and polish that this app provides.

One area that I never used was the Git/GitHub integration. While PyCharm does a nice job of making the process as simple
as possible, it took me a lot of trial and error to get it to work. I was able to **commit**, but for some reason the 
change never made it to GitHub. After pulling what was left of my hair out, I decided to give it one more shot.

The following is the procedure that finally succeded:

1. Select VCS on Menubar and choose Commit
2. Add an appropriate comment. Be sure to use assertive language to follow standards
3. This is the key, instead of just clicking on Commit, **hover** over button until **Commit and Push** is shown
4. Check on GitHub to ensure that the update was **Pushed**

Merry Christmas everyone. Since I did not check in yesterday I decided to make a change from the CLI instead of PyCharm
